This was my project for Tribehacks IX. I wanted to design some kind of model to predict running performance based on quantitative metrics.
The Jupyter notebook contains my analysis of the data, including machine learning models and algorithms from scikit. The main python file
contains the models implemented into a user interactive application, which accepts metrics from the user to predict running abilities.
